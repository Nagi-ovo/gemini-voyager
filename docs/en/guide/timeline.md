# Time Travel

Long conversations are messy. You scroll up, you scroll down, you lose your place.
Gemini Voyager turns your conversation into a timeline.

## See the Shape of Your Chat
Look at the right side of your screen.
Each node represents a message. The timeline visualizes the rhythm of your dialogue.

## Navigation, Solved.
- **Teleport**: Click a node to jump instantly to that message.
- **Peek**: Hover to see what’s inside without moving.
- **Bookmark**: Long-press a node to **Star** it. It’s like a bookmark for your brain.
