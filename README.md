  <h1>Gemini Voyager</h1>
  <h5>A Chrome extension that adds a silky, interactive timeline to your Gemini chats.</h5>
</div>

## Intro <a name="intro"></a>

**Gemini Voyager** enhances `https://gemini.google.com/app` with a compact, elegant timeline:

- Your messages are mapped to dots; click to jump or flow to the message.
- Hover to preview the prompt (3‑line clamp with gradient fade).
- Long‑press to star a dot; stars sync across tabs.
- Robust SPA observers keep the active state in sync while you scroll.


## Getting Started <a name="gettingStarted"></a>

### Load your extension (Chrome)

1. Open - Chrome browser
2. Access - [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
3. Tick - Developer mode
4. Find - Load unpacked extension
5. Select - `dist_chrome` folder in this project (after dev or build)

Note: Edge (Chromium) can also load `dist_chrome` as an unpacked extension, but this project primarily targets Chrome.
