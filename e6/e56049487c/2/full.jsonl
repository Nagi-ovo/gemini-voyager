Manual Release (Recommended for \"One-Click\" Releases)\n#    - How: Go to \"Actions\" -> \"Release\" -> \"Run workflow\".\n#    - Input: Optional \"Version\" (e.g., 1.2.0). If left empty, it auto-increments the patch version.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Calculates the next version.\n#      2. Bumps version in package.json & manifest.json.\n#      3. Commits \"chore(release): vX.Y.Z\".\n#      4. Creates git tag \"vX.Y.Z\".\n#      5. Pushes commit & tag to main.\n#      6. Builds artifacts and creates a GitHub Release.\n#\n# 2. Tag-based Release (Manual Tagging)\n#    - How: run `git commit -m \"...\" && git tag v1.2.0 && git push origin v1.2.0` locally.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Detects the pushed tag (v1.2.0).\n#      2. SKIPS version calculation and bumping (assumes you already did it).\n#      3. Builds artifacts from that tag.\n#      4. Creates a GitHub Release for that tag.\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - 'v*'\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      version:\n        description: 'Version to release (e.g. 1.0.8) - leave empty to auto-increment patch version'\n        required: false\n        type: string\n      notes:\n        description: 'Release notes (optional)'\n        required: false\n        type: string\n\npermissions:\n  contents: write\n\njobs:\n  # Job 1: Calculate & Bump Version (Only runs on manual trigger)\n  bump-version:\n    if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    outputs:\n      new_version: ${{ steps.next_version.outputs.version }}\n      tag_name: ${{ steps.tag.outputs.name }}\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 0\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n      - name: Setup Node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: '20'\n\n      - name: Calculate next version\n        id: next_version\n        run: |\n          if [ -n \"${{ inputs.version }}\" ];

The user has a release workflow that:\n1. Builds all platform extensions\n2. Zips Chrome dist\n3. Signs Firefox and submits to AMO automatically using `web-ext sign`\n4. Creates a GitHub Release with all artifacts\n\nThey want to also auto-publish to:\n- Chrome Web Store\n- Microsoft Edge Add-ons\n\nLet me now provide comprehensive guidance on adding these two auto-publish steps. I need to cover:\n\n1. **Chrome Web Store**: \n   - Requires: `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `refreshToken`, `extId`\n   - Use: `mnao305/chrome-extension-upload` or `PlasmoHQ/bpp` or `browser-actions/release-chrome-extension`\n   - Getting credentials: Google Cloud Console OAuth setup + `pnpm dlx gcp-refresh-token`\n\n2. **Microsoft Edge Add-ons**:\n   - Requires: `clientId`, `apiKey`, `productId`\n   - Use: `wdzeng/edge-addon@v2`\n   - Getting credentials: Microsoft Partner Center\n\nI'm comparing the available Chrome upload actions to recommend the most reliable option, and it looks like `mnao305/chrome-extension-upload` and `trmcnvn/upload-chrome-extension` are the most commonly used, while `wdzeng/edge-addon@v2` is the standard for Edge submissions.\n\nI should also consider whether Plasmo BPP could handle both platforms simultaneously, though I need to verify the current build setup—the Chrome build goes to `dist_chrome` and gets zipped as `gemini-voyager-chrome-${TAG}.zip`, while the Edge build is repackaged from the Chrome version in `dist_edge`. Since the Edge build is derived from Chrome, I might need separate upload steps for each platform depending on which action I recommend.\n\nLooking at the available options, `mnao305/chrome-extension-upload` seems like the most reliable choice for Chrome, and `wdzeng/edge-addon@v2` for Edge—I could add both as separate steps in the existing build-and-release job after the archive step rather than trying to integrate a more complex tool like Plasmo BPP. about what the user needs for their specific setup. For Chrome, I need to use the `mnao305/chrome-extension-upload` action with the existing zip file and credentials like `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, `REFRESH_TOKEN`, and the extension's `APP_ID`. For Edge, since the build process already handles repackaging the Chrome build, I just need to zip the `dist_edge` folder and use `wdzeng/edge-addon` with the Edge-specific credentials. Let me put together the complete workflow with these exact steps.\n\nNow I'm thinking through where to get these credentials. For Chrome, I'll need to set up OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console and use a tool to generate the refresh token, then add all three values to GitHub secrets. For Edge, the process goes through Microsoft Partner Center where I can find the API key and client ID, pull the product ID from the store URL, and add those three values to secrets as well. Then I can finalize the exact YAML changes needed.\n\nLooking at the build process, `bun run build:all` handles all platforms including Edge, which outputs to `dist_edge`. I should add the Chrome and Edge publishing steps right after the artifact archiving, before the Firefox signing step.\n\nFor these store publishing steps, I need to consider making them conditional so they don't fail if secrets aren't configured yet—using environment variables with `if` conditions is the cleanest approach.

Let me summarize:\n\n**Chrome - underlying library `fregante/chrome-webstore-upload`:**\n- 404 stars, 55 forks, actively maintained (Oct 2025 release)\n- The wrapper action `mnao305/chrome-extension-upload` only has 135 stars\n- The underlying library is much more reputable than the wrapper action\n\n**Edge - `wdzeng/edge-addon`:**\n- Only 24 stars, 2 forks - very low adoption\n- Uses official Microsoft Edge Add-ons API v1.1\n\n\n- Code is open source and reviewable\n\n**Security assessment:**\n- Both actions handle sensitive credentials like OAuth tokens and API keys, passing them to official platform APIs, so the main risk is whether the action code itself might leak these secrets\n- Since both are open source, I can audit the code myself, and GitHub Actions ensures credentials stay within the runner unless the action explicitly exfiltrates them\n- The safer approach is pinning to a specific commit SHA rather than a version tag to prevent supply chain attacks where a tag gets updated with malicious code\n- For Chrome, using `fregante/chrome-webstore-upload-cli` directly would be a better alternative since it's more trusted and removes the middleman action, or I could use `browser-actions/release-chrome-extension` which has more community adoption\n- For Edge, I could call the official Microsoft API directly with curl commands instead of relying on a wrapper\n\n**Key security concerns:**\n- Tag pinning matters because `uses: mnao305/chrome-extension-upload@v5.0.0` can be moved or reused, whereas pinning to a specific SHA prevents that\n- The `wdzeng/edge-addon` action has very low adoption at 24 stars, meaning less community scrutiny and review\n- Both actions are open source and auditable, which is good, but the underlying libraries may be more trustworthy than the wrappers themselves\n\nMy honest take is that for Chrome, the `mnao305` wrapper works fine but calling `fregante/chrome-webstore-upload` directly or using the more popular `browser-actions/release-chrome-extension` would be safer, and for Edge, I should consider using the official Microsoft API directly rather than relying on a low-adoption wrapper.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":339,"cache_creation_input_tokens":997,"cache_read_input_tokens":50365,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":997},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYUkDMNdG1tfmpJgB4xnr","type":"assistant","uuid":"31c169f3-0c9c-4108-a3ad-7fdb381df9d6","timestamp":"2026-02-25T11:57:19.531Z"}

Let me summarize:\n\n**Chrome - Options:**\n1. `mnao305/chrome-extension-upload` - 135 stars, wrapper for `fregante/chrome-webstore-upload`\n2. `fregante/chrome-webstore-upload` - 404 stars, the underlying library itself (more trustworthy)\n3. `browser-actions/release-chrome-extension` - only 6 stars\n4. BPP (PlasmoHQ/bpp) - from Plasmo, a well-known extension framework company\n\n**Edge - Options:**\n\n\n1. `wdzeng/edge-addon` - 24 stars, very low adoption\n2. Direct API calls using curl - no third-party trust needed\n\n**Security assessment - honest take:**\n\nThese actions are legitimate and open source, using official APIs with standard credential handling, but the low star counts mean limited community scrutiny. The real vulnerability is supply chain risk—if an author deletes and recreates a pinned tag or the repo gets compromised, your secrets could be exposed.\n\nThe safest approach is pinning to commit SHAs instead of version tags. For Chrome, I could skip the action wrapper entirely and call `fregante/chrome-webstore-upload-cli` directly via `npx`—it's more established with 482 stars. For Edge, hitting Microsoft's API directly with curl eliminates third-party dependencies altogether.\n\nSetting up the npx command... Setting up the Edge API authentication and upload flow...\n\nThis approach keeps everything self-contained without needing external services, which is the most secure option. Let me think through the tradeoffs between different deployment strategies.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":298,"cache_read_input_tokens":53249,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":298},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYUkG5xWiZyWEihpBNrNp","type":"assistant","uuid":"f29546a3-ad4c-47ff-aa3e-a60267a45637","timestamp":"2026-02-25T11:57:51.307Z"}

Manual Release (Recommended for \"One-Click\" Releases)\n#    - How: Go to \"Actions\" -> \"Release\" -> \"Run workflow\".\n#    - Input: Optional \"Version\" (e.g., 1.2.0). If left empty, it auto-increments the patch version.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Calculates the next version.\n#      2. Bumps version in package.json & manifest.json.\n#      3. Commits \"chore(release): vX.Y.Z\".\n#      4. Creates git tag \"vX.Y.Z\".\n#      5. Pushes commit & tag to main.\n#      6. Builds artifacts and creates a GitHub Release.\n#\n# 2. Tag-based Release (Manual Tagging)\n#    - How: run `git commit -m \"...\" && git tag v1.2.0 && git push origin v1.2.0` locally.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Detects the pushed tag (v1.2.0).\n#      2. SKIPS version calculation and bumping (assumes you already did it).\n#      3. Builds artifacts from that tag.\n#      4. Creates a GitHub Release for that tag.\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - 'v*'\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      version:\n        description: 'Version to release (e.g. 1.0.8) - leave empty to auto-increment patch version'\n        required: false\n        type: string\n      notes:\n        description: 'Release notes (optional)'\n        required: false\n        type: string\n\npermissions:\n  contents: write\n\njobs:\n  # Job 1: Calculate & Bump Version (Only runs on manual trigger)\n  bump-version:\n    if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    outputs:\n      new_version: ${{ steps.next_version.outputs.version }}\n      tag_name: ${{ steps.tag.outputs.name }}\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 0\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n      - name: Setup Node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: '20'\n\n      - name: Calculate next version\n        id: next_version\n        run: |\n          if [ -n \"${{ inputs.version }}\" ];

It removes the `key` field from dist_chrome's manifest\n\n2. `build:all` does NOT include `build:edge` - this is intentional since `build:edge` modifies `dist_chrome`\n\n3. \n\nThe Edge zip gets named with a `v` prefix using the package.json version. The real issue is the ordering in the CI workflow—if Chrome gets zipped after `build:edge` runs, it'll lose the `key` field too, though that doesn't actually break Chrome functionality. Let me trace through the current workflow where `bun run build:all` builds Chrome, Firefox, and Safari into their respective directories.\n\nFor Edge, `bun run build:edge` rebuilds Chrome and removes the `key` field before zipping it. The key decision is whether to zip Chrome before or after running `build:edge`—if we zip first, the Chrome artifact stays intact, but `build:edge` will rebuild Chrome anyway which is redundant. If we run `build:edge` first, we avoid the redundancy but need to make sure the Chrome zip happens before that modification.\n\nActually, the `key` field in Chrome's manifest doesn't matter for Web Store submission since the store ignores it, so the safest approach is to run `build:all` first, zip Chrome, then run `build:edge` which handles its own rebuild and zipping.\n\nI'm noticing the naming is consistent though—both zips will use the version from package.json, so `gemini-voyager-chrome-v1.2.8.zip` and `gemini-voyager-edge-v1.2.8.zip` will match up properly. Now I need to add workflow steps for running `build:edge` after the initial build, then set up the publishing steps for Chrome Web Store and the other platforms.\n\nSetting up the Chrome Web Store publish step...\n\nI realize the `if` condition won't work with secrets directly since they're masked in GitHub Actions—I need to use a different approach to check if the credentials exist before attempting the upload. So that approach works. Now I need to figure out the curl commands for publishing to Edge—I'll need to authenticate with Azure AD using client credentials, upload the package, and then publish the submission through the Microsoft Partner Center API.\n\nThe authentication flow requires a tenant ID, client ID, and client secret. I'm fairly confident the tenant ID for Edge Add-ons is the Microsoft Services tenant, but I should verify this against the official documentation rather than relying on what I remember from that blog post, since the exact credentials and token endpoint might be specific to each application registered in Partner Center. I'm realizing the tenant ID for Microsoft consumer accounts in Partner Center is typically the Windows Live tenant `9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad`, though I should verify this against the actual Microsoft Edge Add-ons API documentation to confirm whether it's fixed or account-specific before deciding whether to hardcode it or add it as a fourth secret. I'm realizing I need to verify the exact token endpoint format for the Edge Add-ons API—whether it uses the `common` tenant or requires a specific `access_token_url` from Partner Center—and given the security concerns with third-party actions, I should stick with a direct curl approach once I confirm the correct endpoint details. I see that Partner Center provides the full Access Token URL directly, so I need to store four secrets total for Edge publishing. Now I'm planning out the workflow implementation, starting with adding a build step for the Edge artifact after the existing archive step.\n\nI'm working through the filename pattern that `build:edge` generates—it'll be `gemini-voyager-edge-v{version}.zip` where the version comes from package.json, which gets bumped before the workflow runs. Since the git tag is `v1.2.9`, the resulting zip files will follow the same versioning pattern for both Chrome and Edge.\n\nNow I need to figure out the right command for publishing to the Chrome Web Store using the `chrome-webstore-upload-cli` package, which requires the zip file, extension ID, and client credentials. I'm verifying the exact command structure for the CLI tool—it looks like `upload` is the main command with flags for the source file, extension ID, and OAuth credentials, and there's an optional `--auto-publish` flag to publish immediately after uploading.\n\nFor the Edge API approach, I need to handle the OAuth flow carefully, starting with getting an access token using client credentials.\n\nExtracting the access token and then uploading the package to the draft submission endpoint...\n\nActually, I'm realizing the Edge Add-ons API uses an async workflow—the upload returns a 202 status with a Location header, and I need to poll that endpoint until the operation completes before I can publish. This is more involved than a simple POST request.\n\nGiven that complexity, I could lean on the existing `wdzeng/edge-addon@v2` action and pin it to a specific commit for security, since it already handles the polling logic. But let me try writing a clean curl-based implementation that manages the async polling myself—it's not overly complicated if I structure it right.\n\nWriting the curl script... Writing the submission request...\n\nActually, I need to think through the build order here. The `build:edge` script runs the Chrome build first, which overwrites the dist folder, then modifies the manifest and zips it for Edge. So I need to make sure the artifact archiving happens after both builds complete, or I'll end up with the wrong files.\n\nThe sequence should be: build everything, archive Chrome with the key field intact, then run the Edge build which rebuilds Chrome without the key and creates its own zip. That way both archives are correct and I'm not duplicating work unnecessarily.\n\nFor the filenames, the Edge zip uses `v${version}` from package.json, which matches the TAG format—if the TAG is `v1.2.9` and package.json has `1.2.9`, then both naming schemes produce `gemini-voyager-edge-v1.2.9.zip`. The filenames match up since TAG already includes the `v` prefix. Now I'm thinking about error handling—store submissions can fail for various reasons, so I should add `continue-on-error: true` to let the GitHub Release creation proceed even if publishing fails. I'm also recalling that GitHub Actions allows checking `secrets.XXX != ''` directly in `if` conditions to gracefully skip steps when secrets aren't configured.\n\nWriting the workflow steps... Writing the Edge token exchange...\n\nNow I'm uploading the package to the Edge API and extracting the operation URL from the response headers, then setting up a polling loop to monitor the upload status.\n\nPolling the upload status...\n\nOnce the upload succeeds, I'm submitting the package for publishing to the Edge store.\n\nNow I'm realizing I need to add another secret for the Edge token URL—that makes four Edge-related secrets total, not three. And for the Chrome Web Store upload, I should verify the exact flag for auto-publishing in the CLI tool, since the syntax might differ from what I initially thought. So `--auto-publish` is indeed the right flag for v3. Now I'm considering whether rebuilding Chrome from scratch during the `build:edge` step is worth optimizing—it's a bit redundant since we've already zipped the dist folder, but the current approach works fine even if it's slower, and the user didn't ask me to refactor the build script anyway.\n\nLet me also make sure to update the workflow comments to clarify that this handles both Chrome and Edge publishing, then I'll write out the full edit. I need to add `gemini-voyager-edge-*.zip` to the release files list since the Edge zip won't be matched by the existing patterns, though I'm uncertain whether the user actually wants Edge included in the GitHub Release at all.\n\nNow I'm planning out the specific edits: I'll add the Edge build and publishing steps after the Chrome archive step, update the release files to include the Edge zip, and make sure to mention the `EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL` secret in my response. Let me work through the exact changes needed for the release.yml file. Still writing the publish steps... Still writing deployment logic...\n\nNow I need to update the GitHub Release step to include the Edge add-on zip file alongside the other browser packages. I'm verifying that GitHub Actions allows accessing secrets in `if` conditions—it does work, and if a secret isn't configured, it'll be treated as an empty string, which means the step will be skipped as intended. Now I'm ready to implement these changes.\n\nBoth syntaxes work for the conditional check, with or without the `${{ }}` wrapper. I'm realizing there's a workflow consideration: the `build:edge` step internally runs the Chrome build, which means after the initial Chrome build and archiving, the Edge step rebuilds Chrome (overwriting the dist folder) and removes the `key` field before zipping. So the Chrome zip contains the original version with the key, while the Edge zip has the modified version without it—which is exactly what we want. I should check whether the Edge step also needs to add its zip to the GitHub Release. The Edge zip file will use the same version number from package.json that's already been bumped in the workflow, so it'll match the other release artifacts like the Chrome and Firefox builds.\n\nNow

Manual Release (Recommended for \"One-Click\" Releases)\n#    - How: Go to \"Actions\" -> \"Release\" -> \"Run workflow\".\n#    - Input: Optional \"Version\" (e.g., 1.2.0). If left empty, it auto-increments the patch version.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Calculates the next version.\n#      2. Bumps version in package.json & manifest.json.\n#      3. Commits \"chore(release): vX.Y.Z\".\n#      4. Creates git tag \"vX.Y.Z\".\n#      5. Pushes commit & tag to main.\n#      6. Builds artifacts and creates a GitHub Release.\n#\n# 2. Tag-based Release (Manual Tagging)\n#    - How: run `git commit -m \"...\" && git tag v1.2.0 && git push origin v1.2.0` locally.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Detects the pushed tag (v1.2.0).\n#      2. SKIPS version calculation and bumping (assumes you already did it).\n#      3. Builds artifacts from that tag.\n#      4. Creates a GitHub Release for that tag.\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - 'v*'\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      version:\n        description: 'Version to release (e.g. 1.0.8) - leave empty to auto-increment patch version'\n        required: false\n        type: string\n      notes:\n        description: 'Release notes (optional)'\n        required: false\n        type: string\n\npermissions:\n  contents: write\n\njobs:\n  # Job 1: Calculate & Bump Version (Only runs on manual trigger)\n  bump-version:\n    if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    outputs:\n      new_version: ${{ steps.next_version.outputs.version }}\n      tag_name: ${{ steps.tag.outputs.name }}\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 0\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n      - name: Setup Node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: '20'\n\n      - name: Calculate next version\n        id: next_version\n        run: |\n          if [ -n \"${{ inputs.version }}\" ];

Manual Release (Recommended for \"One-Click\" Releases)\n#    - How: Go to \"Actions\" -> \"Release\" -> \"Run workflow\".\n#    - Input: Optional \"Version\" (e.g., 1.2.0). If left empty, it auto-increments the patch version.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Calculates the next version.\n#      2. Bumps version in package.json & manifest.json.\n#      3. Commits \"chore(release): vX.Y.Z\".\n#      4. Creates git tag \"vX.Y.Z\".\n#      5. Pushes commit & tag to main.\n#      6. Builds artifacts and creates a GitHub Release.\n#\n# 2. Tag-based Release (Manual Tagging)\n#    - How: run `git commit -m \"...\" && git tag v1.2.0 && git push origin v1.2.0` locally.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Detects the pushed tag (v1.2.0).\n#      2. SKIPS version calculation and bumping (assumes you already did it).\n#      3. Builds artifacts from that tag.\n#      4. Creates a GitHub Release for that tag.\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - 'v*'\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      version:\n        description: 'Version to release (e.g. 1.0.8) - leave empty to auto-increment patch version'\n        required: false\n        type: string\n      notes:\n        description: 'Release notes (optional)'\n        required: false\n        type: string\n\npermissions:\n  contents: write\n\njobs:\n  # Job 1: Calculate & Bump Version (Only runs on manual trigger)\n  bump-version:\n    if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    outputs:\n      new_version: ${{ steps.next_version.outputs.version }}\n      tag_name: ${{ steps.tag.outputs.name }}\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 0\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n      - name: Setup Node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: '20'\n\n      - name: Calculate next version\n        id: next_version\n        run: |\n          if [ -n \"${{ inputs.version }}\" ];

Let me think about this carefully:\n\n1. **How OAuth refresh tokens work**: A refresh token is a long-lived credential used to obtain new access tokens. They don't expire on their own *unless* certain conditions are met.\n\n2. **Google OAuth refresh token expiration conditions**:\n   - If the OAuth consent screen is set to \"Testing\" (not published), refresh tokens expire after **7 days**\n   - If the user revokes access\n   - If the user changes their Google account password\n   - If the app hasn't been used for **6 months** (Google's inactive token policy)\n   - If there are more than 50 refresh tokens for the same user+app combination (oldest gets revoked)\n\n3. **For the Chrome Web Store API specifically**:\n   - The OAuth app needs to be published (not in \"Testing\" mode) to get non-expiring refresh tokens\n   - Once published, the refresh token should last indefinitely as long as you use it regularly\n\n4. **The `npx gcp-refresh-token` command**: This is a one-time setup—you run it once, save the token to GitHub Secrets, and that's it. The token won't expire or need refreshing as long as the OAuth app stays published and you're using it regularly, though it can still be revoked if the account password changes, the app goes unused for 6 months, or if the consent screen is set to Testing mode instead of Production.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":36,"cache_read_input_tokens":80223,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":36},"output_tokens":0,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYUtd6sqgiHXj6ekrz3hd","type":"assistant","uuid":"539a0b92-353c-41da-80e9-38caab36e22f","timestamp":"2026-02-25T13:47:24.553Z"}

So they don't want to create a new one. They need a workaround to get the refresh token using their existing web application credentials.\n\nFor a web application OAuth client, the flow is different - you can't use the simple desktop app flow. But you can still get a refresh token, just through a different process.\n\nOptions:\n1. Manually do the OAuth flow using a browser - construct the authorization URL, get the code, exchange for tokens using curl\n2. Use a different tool that supports web app credentials\n3. Just create a simple Node.js script to do the auth flow\n\n\n4. Use the Google OAuth Playground\n\nThe cleanest approach would be to manually walk through the OAuth flow in a browser - I'd construct an authorization URL with the right parameters to request offline access, grab the authorization code after they approve, then exchange it for tokens using curl. I'm realizing the simplest path might be to just modify their existing web app credentials by changing the JSON structure from `web` to `installed` format, since the tool is looking for `installed.client_id` anyway—though I need to verify if that would actually work with the OAuth flow they're using. desktop apps vs web apps might differ slightly (redirect_uri handling), but let's see...\n\nActually, for `gcp-refresh-token`, it opens a local server to handle the redirect. The redirect URI for desktop apps is typically `http://localhost`. For web apps, the redirect URI needs to be configured in the Cloud Console.\n\nIf their web app already has `http://localhost` as a redirect URI, we could just rename the `web` key to `installed` in key.json and it might work.\n\nBut more likely, their web app is configured with specific redirect URIs (like their actual web app URL).\n\nI'm weighing a few approaches here. The OAuth Playground option is straightforward—just add their redirect URI there and use it to grab a refresh token without any code. Creating a quick script is another route, but probably overkill. The cleanest solution though is spinning up a separate Desktop app OAuth client specifically for CI/CD purposes, keeping the existing web app client untouched. Since the Chrome Web Store API doesn't care which OAuth client authorizes the request as long as it has the right scope, this separation keeps things clean. I'd lean toward recommending the new Desktop client approach, with the OAuth Playground as a solid fallback if they want to avoid creating another client. they don't want to create a new client.\n\nActually wait - I should reconsider. If the user has been using this web app OAuth client for the Chrome Web Store, it means they've been using the Chrome Web Store API with it. The question is whether `gcp-refresh-token` can work with it.\n\nActually, I think the simplest fix is Option 1 with OAuth Playground, since that doesn't require creating new credentials. Let me walk through that: they'd go to the OAuth Playground, enable their own credentials in settings, add the playground's redirect URI to their Cloud Console, then use the Chrome Web Store scope to authorize and exchange the code for a refresh token.\n\nBut honestly, creating a new Desktop app credential is probably cleaner—it's quick, doesn't touch their existing web app client, and they can

Manual Release (Recommended for \"One-Click\" Releases)\n#    - How: Go to \"Actions\" -> \"Release\" -> \"Run workflow\".\n#    - Input: Optional \"Version\" (e.g., 1.2.0). If left empty, it auto-increments the patch version.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Calculates the next version.\n#      2. Bumps version in package.json & manifest.json.\n#      3. Commits \"chore(release): vX.Y.Z\".\n#      4. Creates git tag \"vX.Y.Z\".\n#      5. Pushes commit & tag to main.\n#      6. Builds artifacts and creates a GitHub Release.\n#\n# 2. Tag-based Release (Manual Tagging)\n#    - How: run `git commit -m \"...\" && git tag v1.2.0 && git push origin v1.2.0` locally.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Detects the pushed tag (v1.2.0).\n#      2. SKIPS version calculation and bumping (assumes you already did it).\n#      3. Builds artifacts from that tag.\n#      4. Creates a GitHub Release for that tag.\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - 'v*'\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      version:\n        description: 'Version to release (e.g. 1.0.8) - leave empty to auto-increment patch version'\n        required: false\n        type: string\n      notes:\n        description: 'Release notes (optional)'\n        required: false\n        type: string\n\npermissions:\n  contents: write\n\njobs:\n  # Job 1: Calculate & Bump Version (Only runs on manual trigger)\n  bump-version:\n    if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    outputs:\n      new_version: ${{ steps.next_version.outputs.version }}\n      tag_name: ${{ steps.tag.outputs.name }}\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 0\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n      - name: Setup Node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: '20'\n\n      - name: Calculate next version\n        id: next_version\n        run: |\n          if [ -n \"${{ inputs.version }}\" ];

Manual Release (Recommended for \"One-Click\" Releases)\n#    - How: Go to \"Actions\" -> \"Release\" -> \"Run workflow\".\n#    - Input: Optional \"Version\" (e.g., 1.2.0). If left empty, it auto-increments the patch version.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Calculates the next version.\n#      2. Bumps version in package.json & manifest.json.\n#      3. Commits \"chore(release): vX.Y.Z\".\n#      4. Creates git tag \"vX.Y.Z\".\n#      5. Pushes commit & tag to main.\n#      6. Builds artifacts and creates a GitHub Release.\n#\n# 2. Tag-based Release (Manual Tagging)\n#    - How: run `git commit -m \"...\" && git tag v1.2.0 && git push origin v1.2.0` locally.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Detects the pushed tag (v1.2.0).\n#      2. SKIPS version calculation and bumping (assumes you already did it).\n#      3. Builds artifacts from that tag.\n#      4. Creates a GitHub Release for that tag.\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - 'v*'\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      version:\n        description: 'Version to release (e.g. 1.0.8) - leave empty to auto-increment patch version'\n        required: false\n        type: string\n      notes:\n        description: 'Release notes (optional)'\n        required: false\n        type: string\n\npermissions:\n  contents: write\n\njobs:\n  # Job 1: Calculate & Bump Version (Only runs on manual trigger)\n  bump-version:\n    if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    outputs:\n      new_version: ${{ steps.next_version.outputs.version }}\n      tag_name: ${{ steps.tag.outputs.name }}\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 0\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n      - name: Setup Node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: '20'\n\n      - name: Calculate next version\n        id: next_version\n        run: |\n          if [ -n \"${{ inputs.version }}\" ]; then\n            echo \"version=${{ inputs.version }}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n            echo \"Using manual version: ${{ inputs.version }}\"\n          else\n            CURRENT=$(node -e \"console.log(require('./package.json').version)\")\n            echo \"Current version: ${CURRENT}\"\n            \n            IFS='.' read -r MAJOR MINOR PATCH <<< \"$CURRENT\"\n            PATCH=$((PATCH + 1))\n            \n            # Simple carry logic\n            if [ $PATCH -ge 10 ]; then\n              MINOR=$((MINOR + 1))\n              PATCH=0\n            fi\n            if [ $MINOR -ge 10 ]; then\n              MAJOR=$((MAJOR + 1))\n              MINOR=0\n            fi\n            \n            NEXT=\"${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${PATCH}\"\n            echo \"version=${NEXT}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n            echo \"Auto-calculated next version: ${NEXT}\"\n          fi\n\n      - name: Compute tag name\n        id: tag\n        run: echo \"name=v${{ steps.next_version.outputs.version }}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n\n      - name: Update files, commit and push\n        env:\n          VERSION: ${{ steps.next_version.outputs.version }}\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        run: |\n          echo \"Bumping to version ${VERSION}\"\n\n          # Update package.json and manifest.json\n          node -e \"const fs=require('fs');const v=process.env.VERSION;const p=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('package.json','utf8'));p.version=v;fs.writeFileSync('package.json',JSON.stringify(p,null,2)+'\\n');const m=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('manifest.json','utf8'));m.version=v;fs.writeFileSync('manifest.json',JSON.stringify(m,null,2)+'\\n');\"\n\n          git config user.name \"github-actions[bot]\"\n          git config user.email \"github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\"\n\n          git add package.json manifest.json\n          git commit -m \"chore(release): v${VERSION}\" || echo \"No changes to commit\"\n          git tag v${VERSION} || echo \"Tag exists\"\n\n          # Push commit and tag\n          git push origin HEAD:main --tags\n\n  # Job 2: Build & Release (Runs on both manual and tag push)\n  build-and-release:\n    needs: bump-version\n    if: always() && (needs.bump-version.result == 'success' || github.event_name == 'push')\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Set Release Tag Variable\n        id: vars\n        run: |\n          if [ \"${{ github.event_name }}\" == \"workflow_dispatch\" ]; then\n            echo \"tag_name=${{ needs.bump-version.outputs.tag_name }}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n          else\n            echo \"tag_name=${{ github.ref_name }}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n          fi\n\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          ref: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.tag_name }}\n          fetch-depth: 0\n\n      - name: Setup Bun\n        uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2\n        with:\n          bun-version: 'latest'\n\n      - name: Install deps\n        run: bun i\n\n      - name: Build All\n        run: bun run build:all\n\n      - name: Archive artifacts\n        run: |\n          TAG=${{ steps.vars.outputs.tag_name }}\n\n          cd dist_chrome && zip -r ../gemini-voyager-chrome-${TAG}.zip . && cd ..\n\n      - name: Build Edge artifact\n        run: bun run build:edge\n\n      - name: Publish to Microsoft Edge Add-ons\n        if: ${{ secrets.EDGE_CLIENT_ID != '' }}\n        continue-on-error: true\n        env:\n          EDGE_PRODUCT_ID: ${{ secrets.EDGE_PRODUCT_ID }}\n          EDGE_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.EDGE_CLIENT_ID }}\n          EDGE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.EDGE_API_KEY }}\n          EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL: ${{ secrets.EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL }}\n        run: |\n          TAG=${{ steps.vars.outputs.tag_name }}\n\n          # 1.

On line 165:\n\n```yaml\nif: ${{ secrets.EDGE_CLIENT_ID != '' }}\n```\n\nIn GitHub Actions, the `secrets` context is NOT accessible in step-level `if` conditions using the `${{ }}` expression syntax for comparisons like this. You can reference a secret value with `${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}`, but comparing it with `!= ''` doesn't work as expected because secrets are masked and the comparison doesn't work reliably.\n\nActually wait - let me think again. In GitHub Actions, `secrets` context IS available in `if` conditions. The expression `${{ secrets.EDGE_CLIENT_ID != '' }}` should work. \n\nBut I'm second-guessing myself here. Let me reconsider what the actual issue might be. The syntax looks valid on the surface, but there's something about how GitHub Actions handles secrets in conditionals that I'm not quite remembering correctly.\n\nActually, I think the real problem might be that linters and GitHub Actions validators flag using the `secrets` context directly in step-level `if` conditions, even though the YAML syntax itself is technically valid. The linter might be throwing an error because of this limitation.\n\nThe workaround would be to assign the secret to an environment variable first, then check that variable in the `if` condition instead—that way the linter won't complain and the logic stays the same. I'm realizing the `secrets` context is actually available in step `if` conditions according to GitHub Actions documentation, though some linters might flag it incorrectly. Looking more carefully at the YAML syntax, the real issue could be with how the `if` condition is being evaluated or there might be a linter tool in VS Code that's being overly strict about accessing secrets in conditionals. I'm going back and forth on the best approach here. The simplest solution might be to just remove the condition entirely and let the step fail gracefully if secrets aren't configured, using `continue-on-error: true` to prevent the workflow from breaking. Alternatively, I could use the comparison pattern `${{ secrets.EDGE_CLIENT_ID != '' }}` which is more widely accepted by validators. But I should actually focus on identifying what the static error is—the user mentioned \"静态错误\" which could be a YAML syntax or linter issue. Looking at the workflow file more carefully, the indentation appears correct, but I'm wondering if there's something specific on line 165 that's causing the problem. In GitHub Actions, when you use `${{ }}` in an `if:` expression, the expression inside should be valid. But `secrets.EDGE_CLIENT_ID != ''` - this IS valid expression syntax.\n\nHowever, there's a GitHub Actions schema validation issue: some validators flag the use of `secrets` context in step `if` conditions. The schema for GitHub Actions says that the `secrets` context is available in:\n- `jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].if`\n\nSo it should be valid...\n\nOK let me just look at this from a different angle. What common GitHub Actions \"static errors\" are there?\n\n1. Invalid YAML syntax\n2. Schema validation errors (unknown keys, wrong types)\n3. Expression errors\n\nOne thing I notice: the `if` condition check for secrets in step conditions. Some CI/CD static analysis tools (like actionlint) do flag `secrets` usage in step `if` conditions as an error, saying the context isn't available in that position even though GitHub's own schema allows it. The fix would be to either remove the condition entirely and use `continue-on-error: true`, set up environment variables in a preceding step to check instead, or restructure the workflow to use a job-level `if` condition where `secrets` is definitely available.\n\nFor this case, the simplest solution is to just remove the `if` condition since `continue-on-error: true` already handles failures gracefully - if the secrets aren't set, the curl commands will fail, the step fails, but the workflow continues

Manual Release (Recommended for \"One-Click\" Releases)\n#    - How: Go to \"Actions\" -> \"Release\" -> \"Run workflow\".\n#    - Input: Optional \"Version\" (e.g., 1.2.0). If left empty, it auto-increments the patch version.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Calculates the next version.\n#      2. Bumps version in package.json & manifest.json.\n#      3. Commits \"chore(release): vX.Y.Z\".\n#      4. Creates git tag \"vX.Y.Z\".\n#      5. Pushes commit & tag to main.\n#      6. Builds artifacts and creates a GitHub Release.\n#\n# 2. Tag-based Release (Manual Tagging)\n#    - How: run `git commit -m \"...\" && git tag v1.2.0 && git push origin v1.2.0` locally.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Detects the pushed tag (v1.2.0).\n#      2. SKIPS version calculation and bumping (assumes you already did it).\n#      3. Builds artifacts from that tag.\n#      4. Creates a GitHub Release for that tag.\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - 'v*'\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      version:\n        description: 'Version to release (e.g. 1.0.8) - leave empty to auto-increment patch version'\n        required: false\n        type: string\n      notes:\n        description: 'Release notes (optional)'\n        required: false\n        type: string\n\npermissions:\n  contents: write\n\njobs:\n  # Job 1: Calculate & Bump Version (Only runs on manual trigger)\n  bump-version:\n    if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    outputs:\n      new_version: ${{ steps.next_version.outputs.version }}\n      tag_name: ${{ steps.tag.outputs.name }}\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 0\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n      - name: Setup Node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: '20'\n\n      - name: Calculate next version\n        id: next_version\n        run: |\n          if [ -n \"${{ inputs.version }}\" ]; then\n            echo \"version=${{ inputs.version }}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n            echo \"Using manual version: ${{ inputs.version }}\"\n          else\n            CURRENT=$(node -e \"console.log(require('./package.json').version)\")\n            echo \"Current version: ${CURRENT}\"\n            \n            IFS='.' read -r MAJOR MINOR PATCH <<< \"$CURRENT\"\n            PATCH=$((PATCH + 1))\n            \n            # Simple carry logic\n            if [ $PATCH -ge 10 ]; then\n              MINOR=$((MINOR + 1))\n              PATCH=0\n            fi\n            if [ $MINOR -ge 10 ]; then\n              MAJOR=$((MAJOR + 1))\n              MINOR=0\n            fi\n            \n            NEXT=\"${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${PATCH}\"\n            echo \"version=${NEXT}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n            echo \"Auto-calculated next version: ${NEXT}\"\n          fi\n\n      - name: Compute tag name\n        id: tag\n        run: echo \"name=v${{ steps.next_version.outputs.version }}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n\n      - name: Update files, commit and push\n        env:\n          VERSION: ${{ steps.next_version.outputs.version }}\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        run: |\n          echo \"Bumping to version ${VERSION}\"\n\n          # Update package.json and manifest.json\n          node -e \"const fs=require('fs');const v=process.env.VERSION;const p=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('package.json','utf8'));p.version=v;fs.writeFileSync('package.json',JSON.stringify(p,null,2)+'\\n');const m=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('manifest.json','utf8'));m.version=v;fs.writeFileSync('manifest.json',JSON.stringify(m,null,2)+'\\n');\"\n\n          git config user.name \"github-actions[bot]\"\n          git config user.email \"github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\"\n\n          git add package.json manifest.json\n          git commit -m \"chore(release): v${VERSION}\" || echo \"No changes to commit\"\n          git tag v${VERSION} || echo \"Tag exists\"\n\n          # Push commit and tag\n          git push origin HEAD:main --tags\n\n  # Job 2: Build & Release (Runs on both manual and tag push)\n  build-and-release:\n    needs: bump-version\n    if: always() && (needs.bump-version.result == 'success' || github.event_name == 'push')\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Set Release Tag Variable\n        id: vars\n        run: |\n          if [ \"${{ github.event_name }}\" == \"workflow_dispatch\" ]; then\n            echo \"tag_name=${{ needs.bump-version.outputs.tag_name }}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n          else\n            echo \"tag_name=${{ github.ref_name }}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n          fi\n\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          ref: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.tag_name }}\n          fetch-depth: 0\n\n      - name: Setup Bun\n        uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2\n        with:\n          bun-version: 'latest'\n\n      - name: Install deps\n        run: bun i\n\n      - name: Build All\n        run: bun run build:all\n\n      - name: Archive artifacts\n        run: |\n          TAG=${{ steps.vars.outputs.tag_name }}\n\n          cd dist_chrome && zip -r ../gemini-voyager-chrome-${TAG}.zip . && cd ..\n\n      - name: Build Edge artifact\n        run: bun run build:edge\n\n      - name: Publish to Microsoft Edge Add-ons\n        if: ${{ secrets.EDGE_CLIENT_ID != '' }}\n        continue-on-error: true\n        env:\n          EDGE_PRODUCT_ID: ${{ secrets.EDGE_PRODUCT_ID }}\n          EDGE_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.EDGE_CLIENT_ID }}\n          EDGE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.EDGE_API_KEY }}\n          EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL: ${{ secrets.EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL }}\n        run: |\n          TAG=${{ steps.vars.outputs.tag_name }}\n\n          # 1.

Looking at the workflow, the issue is in the `env` block of the \"Publish to Microsoft Edge Add-ons\" step:\n\n```yaml\n        env:\n          EDGE_PRODUCT_ID: ${{ secrets.EDGE_PRODUCT_ID }}\n          EDGE_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.EDGE_CLIENT_ID }}\n          EDGE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.EDGE_API_KEY }}\n          EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL: ${{ secrets.EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL }}\n```\n\nThe linter (`actionlint`) is flagging `secrets.EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL` as potentially invalid - meaning it doesn't recognize this as a defined secret. This is likely because `actionlint` can check if secrets are defined in the workflow or not, and `EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL` wasn't declared anywhere.\n\n\nActually, `actionlint` can't validate secret names against what's configured in the repository since it doesn't have access to that information. The error is probably coming from the GitHub Actions VS Code extension using the workflow schema to validate expressions, and it might be flagging this because of the secret name format or some other validation rule.\n\nWait, I think I've got it - the extension uses JSON Schema to validate the YAML, and that schema might have a strict list of valid secret names based on what's declared in the `secrets:` section. Or maybe the issue is that this is being treated as an `env` variable instead of a secret.\n\nLet me reconsider the error message itself. It's complaining about a context access being invalid, which suggests either `env.EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL` isn't properly declared, or `secrets.EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL` isn't recognized. For `workflow_call` secrets that are explicitly declared, `actionlint` can validate them, but repository secrets accessed directly are usually allowed. There might be a naming convention issue at play here, or possibly something about how the value itself is being interpreted.\n\nActually, I think the simplest solution is to hardcode the Microsoft OAuth token URL directly in the script instead of relying on a secret. The base URL for Microsoft's login service is fixed, so I could parameterize just the tenant ID as `EDGE_TENANT_ID` instead, which would eliminate the need for the full URL as a secret.\n\nBut wait—looking at the error message again, \"Context access might be invalid: EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL\" suggests the linter is flagging the variable itself as potentially invalid, even though it's clearly defined in the `env:` section. The shell variable syntax `${EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL}` should work fine, so the linter might be confused about something else entirely.\n\nI'm thinking the real issue could be that the GitHub Actions extension is validating the secret name `${{ secrets.EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL }}` against some schema and finding it doesn't match expected patterns. Since the Microsoft OAuth URL follows a predictable format with just the tenant ID varying, I could simplify this by storing only the tenant ID as a secret and constructing the full URL in the script instead. Though honestly, that doesn't really address the underlying linter complaint.\n\nWait, let me reconsider what the error is actually saying. When I look at the bash variable `${EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL}` in the run block, `actionlint` should be able to trace it back to the env declaration, so maybe the issue is something else entirely—perhaps the linter is complaining because the secret name itself doesn't conform to whatever pattern it expects.\n\nActually, I think I've been overcomplicating this. The GitHub Actions linter is probably just warning that it can't verify `secrets.EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL` is valid since it's not declared in the workflow's `on.workflow_call.secrets` section. Since the user mentioned this is a static error they want to fix, I should think about what the actual solutions would be.\n\nThe simplest approach might be to just rename the secret to something like `EDGE_TENANT_ID` and construct the URL inline in the workflow, which would be cleaner than storing a full URL as a secret anyway.\n\nBut I'm realizing the linter error is specifically about the `secrets.EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL` expression itself—it's flagging that particular context access as potentially invalid, so renaming the secret might actually resolve it.\n\nActually, stepping back, I think the real issue is that the linter doesn't recognize repository secrets unless they're explicitly declared in a reusable workflow's `secrets` section. For standard workflows triggered by push or workflow_dispatch, all repository secrets should be available at runtime, so this warning is likely a false positive. I can either ignore it since it works correctly, or suppress the warning in the workflow. I'm realizing the real issue might be that I don't need `EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL` as a separate secret at all—I could just store the tenant ID and construct the full OAuth endpoint URL in the script itself, since the format is predictable. But that still won't silence the linter warning, it'll just shift it to complaining about `EDGE_TENANT_ID` instead. I'm realizing the warning might stem from the linter flagging secret names that look like they contain URLs, or possibly checking against an allowed list of secret names. Either way, renaming to `EDGE_TENANT_ID` and constructing the token URL within the script is the cleaner solution, so I'll go ahead with that approach. I'm realizing the linter warning would actually appear for any new secret name, not just this one—the VS Code extension can't validate secrets it doesn't know about. So renaming to `EDGE_TENANT_ID` wouldn't solve the underlying issue; I'd need to either suppress the warning with a comment, configure the linter differently, or avoid using secrets context altogether.\n\nBut the user mentioned this is a static error, not just a warning, which makes me think this might be coming from `actionlint` rather than the extension. If `actionlint` is flagging `secrets.EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL` as invalid, it could be because the secret name doesn't match the schema, or there's an issue with how the environment variable is being referenced in the shell script.\n\nLet me think about the practical solutions here. The most likely fixes are either suppressing the `actionlint` error with a comment, adjusting how the secret is referenced, or checking if there's a genuine schema mismatch. I should probably start by assuming this is a false positive from the linter and suggest the simplest workaround.\n\nActually, I'm realizing the user's error message \"Context access might be invalid: EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL\" is almost certainly coming from the GitHub Actions VS Code extension's schema validation. It's flagging this particular secret as potentially unknown, which is odd since it should either flag all of them or none of them—unless there's something specific about how that secret name is being validated.\n\nMy best guess is that the user has already configured some of these secrets in their GitHub repository settings (EDGE_PRODUCT_ID, EDGE_CLIENT_ID, EDGE_API_KEY), but not EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL yet, and the VS Code extension is checking against what's actually stored in the repository. the user might be using `actionlint` as a pre-commit hook or something, and the specific error is from actionlint. Actionlint typically doesn't validate secret names against a registry though, so that seems unlikely. I think the most practical solution here is to either accept this as a false positive, or refactor the approach entirely—instead of storing the full URL as a secret, I could just store the tenant ID and construct the URL dynamically in the script. Since the user wants to fix it, I'll go with replacing the `EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL` secret with just the tenant ID.\n\nNow I'm updating the workflow to construct the URL from the tenant ID

Manual Release (Recommended for \"One-Click\" Releases)\n#    - How: Go to \"Actions\" -> \"Release\" -> \"Run workflow\".\n#    - Input: Optional \"Version\" (e.g., 1.2.0). If left empty, it auto-increments the patch version.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Calculates the next version.\n#      2. Bumps version in package.json & manifest.json.\n#      3. Commits \"chore(release): vX.Y.Z\".\n#      4. Creates git tag \"vX.Y.Z\".\n#      5. Pushes commit & tag to main.\n#      6. Builds artifacts and creates a GitHub Release.\n#\n# 2. Tag-based Release (Manual Tagging)\n#    - How: run `git commit -m \"...\" && git tag v1.2.0 && git push origin v1.2.0` locally.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Detects the pushed tag (v1.2.0).\n#      2. SKIPS version calculation and bumping (assumes you already did it).\n#      3. Builds artifacts from that tag.\n#      4. Creates a GitHub Release for that tag.\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - 'v*'\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      version:\n        description: 'Version to release (e.g. 1.0.8) - leave empty to auto-increment patch version'\n        required: false\n        type: string\n      notes:\n        description: 'Release notes (optional)'\n        required: false\n        type: string\n\npermissions:\n  contents: write\n\njobs:\n  # Job 1: Calculate & Bump Version (Only runs on manual trigger)\n  bump-version:\n    if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    outputs:\n      new_version: ${{ steps.next_version.outputs.version }}\n      tag_name: ${{ steps.tag.outputs.name }}\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 0\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n      - name: Setup Node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: '20'\n\n      - name: Calculate next version\n        id: next_version\n        run: |\n          if [ -n \"${{ inputs.version }}\" ]; then\n            echo \"version=${{ inputs.version }}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n            echo \"Using manual version: ${{ inputs.version }}\"\n          else\n            CURRENT=$(node -e \"console.log(require('./package.json').version)\")\n            echo \"Current version: ${CURRENT}\"\n            \n            IFS='.' read -r MAJOR MINOR PATCH <<< \"$CURRENT\"\n            PATCH=$((PATCH + 1))\n            \n            # Simple carry logic\n            if [ $PATCH -ge 10 ]; then\n              MINOR=$((MINOR + 1))\n              PATCH=0\n            fi\n            if [ $MINOR -ge 10 ]; then\n              MAJOR=$((MAJOR + 1))\n              MINOR=0\n            fi\n            \n            NEXT=\"${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${PATCH}\"\n            echo \"version=${NEXT}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n            echo \"Auto-calculated next version: ${NEXT}\"\n          fi\n\n      - name: Compute tag name\n        id: tag\n        run: echo \"name=v${{ steps.next_version.outputs.version }}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n\n      - name: Update files, commit and push\n        env:\n          VERSION: ${{ steps.next_version.outputs.version }}\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        run: |\n          echo \"Bumping to version ${VERSION}\"\n\n          # Update package.json and manifest.json\n          node -e \"const fs=require('fs');const v=process.env.VERSION;const p=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('package.json','utf8'));p.version=v;fs.writeFileSync('package.json',JSON.stringify(p,null,2)+'\\n');const m=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('manifest.json','utf8'));m.version=v;fs.writeFileSync('manifest.json',JSON.stringify(m,null,2)+'\\n');\"\n\n          git config user.name \"github-actions[bot]\"\n          git config user.email \"github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\"\n\n          git add package.json manifest.json\n          git commit -m \"chore(release): v${VERSION}\" || echo \"No changes to commit\"\n          git tag v${VERSION} || echo \"Tag exists\"\n\n          # Push commit and tag\n          git push origin HEAD:main --tags\n\n  # Job 2: Build & Release (Runs on both manual and tag push)\n  build-and-release:\n    needs: bump-version\n    if: always() && (needs.bump-version.result == 'success' || github.event_name == 'push')\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Set Release Tag Variable\n        id: vars\n        run: |\n          if [ \"${{ github.event_name }}\" == \"workflow_dispatch\" ]; then\n            echo \"tag_name=${{ needs.bump-version.outputs.tag_name }}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n          else\n            echo \"tag_name=${{ github.ref_name }}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n          fi\n\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          ref: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.tag_name }}\n          fetch-depth: 0\n\n      - name: Setup Bun\n        uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2\n        with:\n          bun-version: 'latest'\n\n      - name: Install deps\n        run: bun i\n\n      - name: Build All\n        run: bun run build:all\n\n      - name: Archive artifacts\n        run: |\n          TAG=${{ steps.vars.outputs.tag_name }}\n\n          cd dist_chrome && zip -r ../gemini-voyager-chrome-${TAG}.zip . && cd ..\n\n      - name: Build Edge artifact\n        run: bun run build:edge\n\n      - name: Publish to Microsoft Edge Add-ons\n        continue-on-error: true\n        env:\n          EDGE_PRODUCT_ID: ${{ secrets.EDGE_PRODUCT_ID }}\n          EDGE_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.EDGE_CLIENT_ID }}\n          EDGE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.EDGE_API_KEY }}\n          EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL: ${{ secrets.EDGE_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL }}\n        run: |\n          TAG=${{ steps.vars.outputs.tag_name }}\n\n          # 1.

Wait, let me check the actual action more carefully - the marketplace URL is `publish-edge-add-on` but the example shows `wdzeng/edge-addon@v2`. Let me fetch the actual marketplace page to confirm which action this is.\n\nActually looking at the result, it seems like the page redirected to `wdzeng/edge-addon@v2` based on the example YAML. But the user specifically referenced the marketplace URL \"publish-edge-add-on\". Let me check if there's a different action.\n\n\nThere's also `nickvdyck/github-action-publish-edge-addon` that could match that marketplace URL, but looking at the example YAML with `uses: wdzeng/edge-addon@v2`, this is the action I should recommend. It handles OAuth internally and only requires `product-id`, `zip-path`, `api-key`, and `client-id` - no tenant ID needed.\n\nThe user explicitly wants to use this action, so I should implement it rather than worry about the low star count. I'll use the action directly, though ideally I'd pin it to a commit SHA for better security. Let me verify this is the same action referenced in the marketplace link they provided.\n\nConfirming that `wdzeng/edge-addon@v2` is indeed the right action - it requires `product-id`, `zip-path`, `api-key`, and `client-id`, which is much cleaner than the custom curl approach since I don't need to handle tenant IDs or access token URLs. I already have all three secrets configured, so I can swap out the entire curl block for this action.\n\nUpdating the step now...\n\nWriting the action configuration... I'm cleaning up the workflow step to use the proper syntax for GitHub Actions — removing the conflicting `env` declarations and relying on `with` to pass inputs to the action instead.","signature":"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

Manual Release (Recommended for \"One-Click\" Releases)\n#    - How: Go to \"Actions\" -> \"Release\" -> \"Run workflow\".\n#    - Input: Optional \"Version\" (e.g., 1.2.0). If left empty, it auto-increments the patch version.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Calculates the next version.\n#      2. Bumps version in package.json & manifest.json.\n#      3. Commits \"chore(release): vX.Y.Z\".\n#      4. Creates git tag \"vX.Y.Z\".\n#      5. Pushes commit & tag to main.\n#      6. Builds artifacts and creates a GitHub Release.\n#\n# 2. Tag-based Release (Manual Tagging)\n#    - How: run `git commit -m \"...\" && git tag v1.2.0 && git push origin v1.2.0` locally.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Detects the pushed tag (v1.2.0).\n#      2. SKIPS version calculation and bumping (assumes you already did it).\n#      3. Builds artifacts from that tag.\n#      4. Creates a GitHub Release for that tag.\n\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - 'v*'\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      version:\n        description: 'Version to release (e.g. 1.0.8) - leave empty to auto-increment patch version'\n        required: false\n        type: string\n      notes:\n        description: 'Release notes (optional)'\n        required: false\n        type: string\n\npermissions:\n  contents: write\n\njobs:\n  # Job 1: Calculate & Bump Version (Only runs on manual trigger)\n  bump-version:\n    if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    outputs:\n      new_version: ${{ steps.next_version.outputs.version }}\n      tag_name: ${{ steps.tag.outputs.name }}\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 0\n          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n      - name: Setup Node\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: '20'\n\n      - name: Calculate next version\n        id: next_version\n        run: |\n          if [ -n \"${{ inputs.version }}\" ]; then\n            echo \"version=${{ inputs.version }}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n            echo \"Using manual version: ${{ inputs.version }}\"\n          else\n            CURRENT=$(node -e \"console.log(require('./package.json').version)\")\n            echo \"Current version: ${CURRENT}\"\n            \n            IFS='.' read -r MAJOR MINOR PATCH <<< \"$CURRENT\"\n            PATCH=$((PATCH + 1))\n            \n            # Simple carry logic\n            if [ $PATCH -ge 10 ]; then\n              MINOR=$((MINOR + 1))\n              PATCH=0\n            fi\n            if [ $MINOR -ge 10 ]; then\n              MAJOR=$((MAJOR + 1))\n              MINOR=0\n            fi\n            \n            NEXT=\"${MAJOR}.${MINOR}.${PATCH}\"\n            echo \"version=${NEXT}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n            echo \"Auto-calculated next version: ${NEXT}\"\n          fi\n\n      - name: Compute tag name\n        id: tag\n        run: echo \"name=v${{ steps.next_version.outputs.version }}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n\n      - name: Update files, commit and push\n        env:\n          VERSION: ${{ steps.next_version.outputs.version }}\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        run: |\n          echo \"Bumping to version ${VERSION}\"\n\n          # Update package.json and manifest.json\n          node -e \"const fs=require('fs');const v=process.env.VERSION;const p=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('package.json','utf8'));p.version=v;fs.writeFileSync('package.json',JSON.stringify(p,null,2)+'\\n');const m=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('manifest.json','utf8'));m.version=v;fs.writeFileSync('manifest.json',JSON.stringify(m,null,2)+'\\n');\"\n\n          git config user.name \"github-actions[bot]\"\n          git config user.email \"github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\"\n\n          git add package.json manifest.json\n          git commit -m \"chore(release): v${VERSION}\" || echo \"No changes to commit\"\n          git tag v${VERSION} || echo \"Tag exists\"\n\n          # Push commit and tag\n          git push origin HEAD:main --tags\n\n  # Job 2: Build & Release (Runs on both manual and tag push)\n  build-and-release:\n    needs: bump-version\n    if: always() && (needs.bump-version.result == 'success' || github.event_name == 'push')\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Set Release Tag Variable\n        id: vars\n        run: |\n          if [ \"${{ github.event_name }}\" == \"workflow_dispatch\" ]; then\n            echo \"tag_name=${{ needs.bump-version.outputs.tag_name }}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n          else\n            echo \"tag_name=${{ github.ref_name }}\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n          fi\n\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          ref: ${{ steps.vars.outputs.tag_name }}\n          fetch-depth: 0\n\n      - name: Setup Bun\n        uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2\n        with:\n          bun-version: 'latest'\n\n      - name: Install deps\n        run: bun i\n\n      - name: Build All\n        run: bun run build:all\n\n      - name: Archive artifacts\n        run: |\n          TAG=${{ steps.vars.outputs.tag_name }}\n\n          cd dist_chrome && zip -r ../gemini-voyager-chrome-${TAG}.zip . && cd ..\n\n      - name: Build Edge artifact\n        run: bun run build:edge\n\n      - name: Publish to Microsoft Edge Add-ons\n        continue-on-error: true\n        env:\n          EDGE_PRODUCT_ID: ${{ secrets.EDGE_PRODUCT_ID }}\n          EDGE_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.EDGE_CLIENT_ID }}\n          EDGE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.EDGE_API_KEY }}\n          EDGE_TENANT_ID: ${{ secrets.EDGE_TENANT_ID }}\n        run: |\n          TAG=${{ steps.vars.outputs.tag_name }}\n\n          # 1.

Manual Release (Recommended for \"One-Click\" Releases)\n#    - How: Go to \"Actions\" -> \"Release\" -> \"Run workflow\".\n#    - Input: Optional \"Version\" (e.g., 1.2.0). If left empty, it auto-increments the patch version.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Calculates the next version.\n#      2. Bumps version in package.json & manifest.json.\n#      3. Commits \"chore(release): vX.Y.Z\".\n#      4. Creates git tag \"vX.Y.Z\".\n#      5. Pushes commit & tag to main.\n#      6. Builds artifacts and creates a GitHub Release.\n#\n# 2. Tag-based Release (Manual Tagging)\n#    - How: run `git commit -m \"...\" && git tag v1.2.0 && git push origin v1.2.0` locally.\n#    - What it does:\n#      1. Detects the pushed tag (v1.2.0).\n#      2. SKIPS version calculation and bumping (assumes you already did it).\n#      3. Builds artifacts from that tag.\n#      4.
